# Remote-Weather-Station-IOT-

An IOT based project 'Remote Weather Station' using raspberry pi 3B, DHT11 (Digital Temperature & Humidity) sensor and ThingSpeak™ where the data from the sensor can instantly be forwarded to the website over the internet and using MATLAB® Analysis and Visualization, a graph of the data could be seen on the website which would become easier for the meteorologist to analyze live data, historical data, visualize time series data, visually compare data of the same/different type.
    
For locations where the net cannot be accessed, a datewise csv file can be generated which can further be used for analysis using datascience. 
  
For basic set up and an output to a ssh terminal refer: http://www.circuitbasics.com/how-to-set-up-the-dht11-humidity-sensor-on-the-raspberry-pi/
